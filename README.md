# Car-Detection-Application
 Built a car detection system  using YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm.
 
## YOLO - "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

## It is an object detection model for self-driving vehicles. YOLO model comprised of techniques such as IOU(Intersection over union) and non-max suppression.
